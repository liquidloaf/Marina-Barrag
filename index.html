<p style="color:white"> Marina Barrage will open their nine crest gates of 30-metre-wide and 5-metre-high, during periods of heavy rain to prevent flooding, and to release excess water from the rain into the sea when the tides are low. During high tides, seven giant pumps will be used, draining water into the sea. These pumps are capable of pumping an Olympic-sized swimming pool in a minute. </p>
